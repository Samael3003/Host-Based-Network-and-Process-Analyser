# COMPONENTS REQUIRED :

## 1.	Linux Machine :
 
 In this Project, we are using a Linux Machine as a Server, and also a client. There are many points to consider for having Linux machine to be used in this Project.
 
A computer program or device known as a "server" provides services to other program or devices, sometimes known as "clients." There are many distinct kinds of servers, including web servers, mail servers, DNS servers, database servers, application servers, cloud computing servers, and many more. Over time, the percentage of servers using Unix-like operating systems has increased significantly, with Linux versions leading the way. Today, a greater proportion of servers in data centers and on the Internet use an operating system based on Linux. 

**Reasons behind using Linux:**

1.	Free and Open Source : We can view the source code for Linux, or GNU/Linux if we want; it is free and open source (kernel). We can examine the code to look for bugs, investigate security flaws, or simply learn what that code is doing on your computer (s). Because there are so many open programming interfaces, you can also quickly create and integrate your own programs into a Linux operating system. With the aforementioned characteristics, unlike Windows, we may customize the Linux operating system at its most fundamental levels to fit your server needs. 

2.	Security : The Linux kernel is unquestionably the most Secure one available, making Linux-based operating systems safe and suited for servers. A server must be able to accept service requests from distant clients in order to be helpful, and by allowing some access to its ports, a server is always susceptible. Linux, however, uses a number of security techniques to protect data and services from threats and misuse. Programs like a firewall (like iptables), TCP wrappers (to allow and deny service access), and Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux), which helps to restrict the resources a service can access on a server, can all be used to secure services.

3.	Hardware Support : A variety of computer architectures are solidly supported by Linux, which runs on both new and relatively dated systems. If you have a tight hardware budget, this is one of the most important reasons why Linux is superior to Windows for servers. Linux astonishingly works on technology that is rather old; for instance, the Slackware Linux website is hosted on a Pentium III running at 600 MHz and 512 MB of RAM. On their respective websites, you can find a list of the hardware that each distribution supports, along with any necessary specifications. 

## 2.  A Client-Server Model  :

A client-server paradigm is a networking computing system design that depicts a connection between two or more computers in which the client computers make requests for and receive resources from a potent centralized server computer. It explains how particular devices access the data you keep on servers. Additionally, it enables several clients to launch programs or download files from a single server, maintaining consistency across all devices. Servers are widely used by many businesses in a variety of industries to store and access information because they offer greater processing power and greater storage capacity. 

**The functions of client-server networks can include:**

    ·	Interacting with temporary and local storage
    ·	Sending data requests to a server
    ·	Interfacing between servers and users
    ·	Completing database operations
    ·	Connecting with other servers
    ·	Processing user requests
    ·	Writing files on servers
    ·	Accessing server files
    ·	Querying a database
    ·	Creating interactive web applications
 
 **Components of Client Server Networks :**

**1.	Client :** Thin, thick, and hybrid clients are the three categories used by IT professionals to describe clients or server requesters. For many of a device's fundamental operations, thin clients require the resources and computing power of a server. Devices known as thick clients are capable of doing numerous jobs and processing vast volumes of data without the assistance of a server. Devices known as hybrid clients are those that have the ability to analyse data on their own but depend on a server to retain the data for more involved or repetitive processing operations. 

**2.	Servers :**  Computer hardware or software that offers functionality to its users or customers is referred to as a server. Six different servers are available for usage by IT professionals to set up client-server connections. 

Various kinds of servers include:

1.	**Database servers** : You can use a database server for applications that include highly organised data, such as accounting files or marketing spreadsheets.Users can access internet applications using application servers without having to download a copy on their devices.
2.	**Web servers**: These servers are there to make it easier for users to connect to the internet.
3. **Computing servers**: A computing server offers extra space and power above and beyond what a particular device is capable of.
4.	**Web Proxy** :  A web proxy server serves as a communication bridge between a user's browser and other devices. 
5.	**Domain Name Service (DNS)** : DNS servers interpret the information users enter into the address bars of their browsers, enabling the device to find the website you're looking for on the internet. 

**Working of Client-Server Model :**

The client-server network serves as a data storage system. In this architecture, you can store or set up a lot of the data and programs on a distant server. When a client needs access to a certain file or program, the system makes a server request for the data. Next, the server confirms that the request originates from a system-recognized device. The information is downloaded to the device after the server has confirmed the client credentials. The host server and client devices may be connected via a shared network or the internet. 

## 3.  TCP/IP network interfaces  :

At the Network layer, the TCP/IP Network Interface layer converts IP datagrams into packets that particular network technologies can decipher and transfer. Network interfaces are pieces of network-specific software that interact with network-specific device drivers and the IP layer to give the IP layer a uniform interface to any potential network adapters. Based on the destination address of the packet that needs to be transmitted, the IP layer chooses the suitable network interface. A network address is assigned to each network interface. Any link layer protocol header necessary to send a message to its destination must be added or removed by the Network Interface layer. The network adapter card is managed by the network adapter device driver.
